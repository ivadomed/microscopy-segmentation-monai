# microscopy-segmentation-monai-tutorial

The goal of this repo is to document how to train and use a 2D UNet for 2-class segmentation on microscopy images using [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI). Adaptation of the default SEM segmentation model used in `axondeepseg`, for which the config can be found [here](https://github.com/axondeepseg/default-SEM-model).

The SEM dataset used for training is located here: https://github.com/axondeepseg/data_axondeepseg_sem.git
